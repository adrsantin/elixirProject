Request -> Router -> Check rules -> Designated controller and function

Controller: Takes data from models, adapt them to views and returns to user

render function looks for a html page and returns it

Views and Templates:

    View is connected to a Controller by name
    All views names are loaded on boot
    These names are linked to the templates with same name and the templates are 
    loaded as functions of the views
